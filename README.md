# Stock Report on Top 20 Stocks â€“ FabricAIHack

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a Power BI report on the top 20 stocks, using Microsoft Fabric and OpenAI API for summarizing company descriptions and the latest news. Employed a RandomForestRegressor model from the sklearn library to predict the closing price of these stocks. This project provides near real-time insights into stock prices, company descriptions, and the latest news.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a dedicated workspace named FinanceAI, which has a lakehouse called FinanceLakehouse. Within the lakehouse, three Fabric notebooks are utilized for distinct purposes:

- [Prediction Model Notebook](https://github.com/AkhilGurrapu/FabricAIHack-StockReport/blob/main/Notebooks/Prediction%20Model%20Notebook.ipynb): Fetches stock data and employs a RandomForestRegressor model for predicting the closing prices of stocks and then writing the data into lakehouse after transformations.

- [Company Summary Notebook](https://github.com/AkhilGurrapu/FabricAIHack-StockReport/blob/main/Notebooks/CompanySummaryNotebook.ipynb): Summarizes company descriptions using OpenAI API which is retrieved through the yfinance library and then writing the data into lakehouse.

- [News Summary Notebook](https://github.com/AkhilGurrapu/FabricAIHack-StockReport/blob/main/Notebooks/NewsSummaryNotebook.ipynb): Summarizes Latest Financial news using OpenAI API which is retrieved through the yfinance library and then writing the data into lakehouse.

## Pipeline and Scheduling:

To ensure the analysis reflects the most current data, all notebooks within the 'FinanceLakehouse' are scheduled to run every 5 minutes. This automated pipeline allows for near real-time analysis, providing up-to-date insights into stock performance, news, and company overviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Fabric**: Utilized for seamless integration and management within the Microsoft ecosystem.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the summarization of company descriptions and news articles.
- **yfinance**: A Python library used for fetching real-time market data from Yahoo Finance.
- **RandomForestRegressor & sklearn**: Machine learning tools used for predicting stock prices based on historical data.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive reports and visualizations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:

- Free Microsoft Fabric account
- OpenAI API key

### Setup:

1. **Create a Dedicated Workspace**:

    Start by creating a dedicated workspace named FinanceAI in Microsoft Fabric.

2. **Create a Lakehouse**:

    Within the FinanceAI workspace, create a lakehouse named FinanceLakehouse.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:

    Download the provided notebooks and run them within your FinanceLakehouse.
    [Download Notebooks](https://github.com/AkhilGurrapu/FabricAIHack-StockReport/tree/main/Notebooks)

    The execution of these notebooks will create three different tables within your lakehouse. These tables will be used to generate a Power BI report.

4. **SQL Analytics Endpoint**:

    Switch to the SQL analytics endpoint within your lakehouse.
    
    Create a view for the tickers table with the following SQL query:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT [Ticker]
    FROM [FinanceLakehouse].[dbo].[CompanySummary] AS [$Table]
    ```
    or you can use Visual Query to create a view as shown in the video below.
    
    This view will act as a connecting table to all other tables.

5. **Model View**:

    Add the three tables and the newly created view to the default model view by switching to the model view in your SQL Analytics Endpoint.

6. **Generate the Report:**

    Click on "New Report" to start creating your StocksReport using the data available in your model view.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Leverages RandomForestRegressor and sklearn for accurate predictions of stock closing prices.
- **Company Description Summarization**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to provide concise summaries of company backgrounds.
- **Latest News Summarization**: Keeps you updated with the latest news related to the stocks in focus, using OpenAI's API for summarization.
